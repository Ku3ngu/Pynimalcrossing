# Pynimalcrossing
Script to keep track of animal crossing item prices 

a simple script that prompts the user to enter the type of item (fish, bug, resource, misc) and value of the item, then saves the item in an appropriately titled CSV (fish.csv etc.)

I made this the day the game came out and it saved me a ton of time optimizing money making runs.
